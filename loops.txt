Iterative statements:
Iterative statements are also known as loops
there are 3 types of loops in java
i.while-loop
ii.do--while loop
iii.for loop
*while loop:while loop is used when we don't know how many times the loop will be executed.
syntax-
  while(condition){
   statement block;
  }
  statement-x;
 In while loop first condition will be checked if condition is true,the statements in the statement block gets executed
if condition is false the control goes to next immediate statement(statement-x)
*do--while loop:
 syntax-
  do{
   statement block;
  }while(condition);
  statement-x;
  In do--while loop the statement in the statement block gets executed once then the condition wiil be checked-this is the main
difference between while loop and do--while loop.
*for loop:for loop is used when we know how many times the statements will be executed
  syntax-
   for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
   {
    statement block;
   }
   statement-x;
   in for loop first the condition will be checked if condition is true it executes the statements in statement block
  then it go for increment/decrement.the loop will be executed until the condition is false,if condition is false the control 
 will goes to the next immediate statement.
